## Projects and Exercises

### 01 - Counting Words

In this exercise, we implement simple methods to count words in a text, allowing us to better understand the text's structure and word frequency.

- **Directory:** [01 - Counting Words](https://github.com/dustinober1/Udacity-Natural-Language-Processing/tree/main/01%20-%20Counting%20Words)

### 02 - Text Processing Coding

This module focuses on basic text processing techniques such as tokenization, stemming, lemmatization, and more.

- **Directory:** [02 - Text Processing Coding](https://github.com/dustinober1/Udacity-Natural-Language-Processing/tree/main/02%20-%20Text%20Processing%20Coding)

### 03 - SPAM Classifier with Naive Bayes

This project involves building a SPAM classifier using the Naive Bayes algorithm, a common approach for text classification tasks.

- **Directory:** [03 - SPAM Classifier](https://github.com/dustinober1/Udacity-Natural-Language-Processing/tree/main/03%20-%20SPAM%20Classifier)

### 04 - IBM Watson Bookworm Lab

In this exercise, we use IBM Watson services to perform natural language understanding tasks and explore various NLP capabilities.

- **Directory:** [04 - Bookworm](https://github.com/dustinober1/Udacity-Natural-Language-Processing/tree/main/04%20-%20Bookworm)

### 05 - Topic Modeling

In this project, we explore different topic modeling techniques to discover hidden thematic structures in text data.

- **Directory:** [05 - Topic Modeling](https://github.com/dustinober1/Udacity-Natural-Language-Processing/tree/main/05%20-%20Topic%20Modeling)

### 06 - Sentiment Analysis with a Regular Classifier

We implement sentiment analysis using traditional machine learning classifiers and evaluate their performance.

- **Directory:** [06 - Sentiment Analysis with a Regular Classifier](https://github.com/dustinober1/Udacity-Natural-Language-Processing/tree/main/06%20-%20Sentiment%20Analysis%20with%20a%20Regular%20Classifier)

### 07 - Sentiment Analysis with an RNN

This project involves building a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) for sentiment analysis to capture sequential patterns in text.

- **Directory:** [07 - Sentiment Analysis with an RNN](https://github.com/dustinober1/Udacity-Natural-Language-Processing/tree/main/07%20-%20Sentiment%20Analysis%20with%20an%20RNN)

### 08 - Deep Learning Attention

We explore attention mechanisms in deep learning for NLP tasks, which help models focus on specific parts of the input sequence.

- **Directory:** [08 - Deep Learning Attention](https://github.com/dustinober1/Udacity-Natural-Language-Processing/tree/main/08%20-%20Deep%20Learning%20Attention)

### 09 - Deciphering Code with Character-Level RNNs

In this project, we use character-level RNNs to decipher coded text, showcasing the power of sequence modeling in NLP.

- **Directory:** [09 - Deciphering Code with Character-Level RNNs](https://github.com/dustinober1/Udacity-Natural-Language-Processing/tree/main/09%20-%20Deciphering%20Code%20with%20Character-Level%20RNNs)

### Project 1 - Part of Speech Tagging

The first main project focuses on building a Part of Speech (POS) tagger, a fundamental task in NLP that involves labeling words in a text.

- **Directory:** [Project 1 - Part of Speech Tagging](https://github.com/dustinober1/Udacity-Natural-Language-Processing/tree/main/Project%201%20-%20Part%20of%20Speech%20Tagging)

### Project 2 - NLP Machine Translation

In the second main project, we build a machine translation model to translate text between different languages using deep learning techniques.

- **Directory:** [Project 2 - NLP Machine Translation](https://github.com/dustinober1/Udacity-Natural-Language-Processing/tree/main/Project%202%20-%20NLP%20Machine%20Translation)
